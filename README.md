# SpringFactory

A simple Gutter Drain Grate cover for in-ground PVC pipes.

I have included STL for the object for some common sizes, as rendered from OpenSCAD, as well as the design file, and a 3MF file which includes print recommendations.

All of the code/files are contained within GitHub - GutterDrainGrate

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jshessen/SpringFactory.git
